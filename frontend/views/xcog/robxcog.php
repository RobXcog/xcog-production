    <hr>
   I do not like to talk about myself much but I do like to talk about what I think about, a lot. I am not smart but I am systematic and tenacious in my discovery and design ethics. I have been labeled a renaissance man and while flattered I am wary labels and the strange power they can hold over us.
   <br>
   First and foremost I accept that I am a human and I am bound by human nature or as I would describe it, <strong>our innate capacity</strong>. The short story is that I trust us all to be, well.. us and I find our decisions fascinating. I was molded by tragedy in my life and I have been taken advantaged of for being too nice, I learned early that no act of kindness goes unpunished. Nieve and sheltered was my youth, I exploded into the world and got caught up in "game". 
   <br>My life was strife, made from my own choices so I chose to solve them and get what I could from every moment. I am an introvert and a humanitarian.  I have a stability about me and my thoughts my assumptions have good reasons and if they don't they wont sway my opinoin. I do this through consistant(ish) introspection and self discipline exercises. 
   <hr>
   I hope to share on here and over time who I am, my passions, my fears, my rage and my tears with any and all who may be interested. I will gradually put out my story here that intertwines with other stories even your's since your reading this. . I will state thoughts as I like things to be and as I think things really are and not hopefully how I fear they might. I have been dubbed with a few happy mental disorders (who hasn't now adays right!? heh.. hey. did you just point at me??) anyways when it comes to singleminded focus I can be oblivious to flash mob strip tease in a crowded church. my peers have told me I have problems, I think they just be hating cuz I play guitar and Im a pretty guy. Everyone hates pretty dudes, it's my curse. I digress from my speech of uwavering focus.. wait. nevermind. I have been sitting at this computer withiin 40 yards of this spot for about a year now, and I finally taught myself how to build a website from the gorund up. Also to boot I achieved basic understanding of programming patterns, 9 programming syntaxes, digital-audio production and distribution, image manipulation and color theories, aesthetic sciences, business strategies and emotional and economic psychology, basic trigonometry and differential calculus with some statistics. I am far from what I would call myself comfortable in one of those broad disciplines but I have made a solution for every problem I have faced. <br>

   Thank you for your interest in me and my work. I hope to bring some quality projects to the public soon and I encourage input and critiques from across the whole board. I am always happy to chat about the future. 
   
   though it takes a lot of effort on my part to focus on what I should over what I want. The doctors call it ADD, I call it I have something more interesting available to me. when I feel I am correct though I practice an open mind and know very well that even though we may use the same words, they can represent subtly different thoughts than opinion that   of from what I have come to accept as part of  I am a designer, I love to doodle and play guitar. I am an enthusiast by nature, with a personal pursuit to discover (my) life's mysteries as well as enjoy the ride. I hope to find how I can actualize my potentials or even what my potentials could or should be. I am not classically trained or educated and I've hacked my way through life in many regards but I am tenacious with my focuses and humble with my criticisms (unless I think it's funny to not be, heh ). I have taught myself what I know by reading, watching and experimenting. I, like many, have built upon the shoulders of those who came before me to go farther than I alone could. I do hope that others will build with me, so that we can all go farther than we may-could alone. I hope to provide a launching pad for a few projects here some very community driven with a positive social and economic impact for individuals that may slip through societies fickle views and I hope to share my passions in a valuable way, even my rather dark ones. Out of it all I hope to contribute a positive influence for anyone of mind. I am pro passion, and pro human and I appreciate your attention. Thank You.
