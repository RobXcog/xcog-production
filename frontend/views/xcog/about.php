                                Xcog's current goal is to produce a broadcasting network for the local Portland community that can easily be streamed for free, anonymously and without downloads or annoying interruptions to content. In fact content should be personalized in the near future so that everyone in Portland can have their own, personal <a href="/xcog/yarr" > YarRadi<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>! </a>.  This website is the platform I hope to launch this idea from, <a href="/xcog/yarr" > YarRadi<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>! </a>, is the forefront of this idea. I hope to have useful Portland realtime information readably accessible for anyone, at anytime as well as it's local artists getting the <strong>Xcog</strong> light for air time.

                                  Xcog is the handle that <a href="/robxcog" ></a>Rob Xcog had adopted from a shorthand version of the word "excogitate". Within it is just a word but it holds a philosophical value to him, consciousness and our ability to make decisions. Which he is not sure if choice itself is an illusions all together.
