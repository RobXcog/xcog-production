                                    The always green Xcog team is committed to developing and deploying community driven projects that positively impact Portland's economy and people.<hr>
                                We want to provide paths which protect and foster achievement in individuals to fulfill their potentials for their passions. Experience is given through contribution and contributions will involve activities in essence of beautification, education and    to  the benevolent projects we manifest. Our projects aim to give Portland every advantage our combined talents and art can grant. Xcog prefers scientific approaches to art so it may allow us to share valuable insight with all or any. The intent is to give support and clarity to upcoming artists and talent to give the proverbial <strong>giant's shoulder</strong> a person of passion can launch from.
                                <br> Xcog Design Lab will provide a <strong> lowest cost possible </strong> digital design and technology mentorship to local businesses, civic organizations and residential communities through activities and community service projects that will share a common goal of making Portland look fan-fucking-tastic and always weird.

                                Xcog's current goal is to build and maintain a public broadcasting network of relative information focused with the Portland area. The content is easily accessableby the public, anonymously and without downloads or special software content. In fact content should be personalized in the near future so that everyone in Portland can have their own, personal <a href="/xcog/yarr" > YarRadi<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>! </a>.  This website is the platform I hope to launch this idea from, <a href="/xcog/yarr" > YarRadi<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>! </a>, is the forefront of this idea. I hope to have useful Portland realtime information readably accessible for anyone, at anytime as well as it's local artists getting the <strong>Xcog</strong> light for air time.

                                  Xcog is the handle that <a href="/robxcog" ></a>Rob Xcog had adopted from a shorthand version of the word "excogitate". Within it is just a word but it holds a philosophical value to him, consciousness and our ability to make decisions. Which he is not sure if choice itself is an illusions all together.
