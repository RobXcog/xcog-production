                                Xcog's current goal is to build and maintain a public broadcasting network of relative information focused with the Portland area. The content is easily accessableby the public, anonymously and without downloads or special software content. In fact content should be personalized in the near future so that everyone in Portland can have their own, personal <a href="/xcog/yarr" > YarRadi<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>! </a>.  This website is the platform I hope to launch this idea from, <a href="/xcog/yarr" > YarRadi<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>! </a>, is the forefront of this idea. I hope to have useful Portland realtime information readably accessible for anyone, at anytime as well as it's local artists getting the <strong>Xcog</strong> light for air time.
